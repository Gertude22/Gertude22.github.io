    <h1> Welcome Home Rosko </h1>
    <p>
    Welcome home Rosko! The day I went to go pick up my kitten it was a sunny day I had the materials that I needed to take care of rosko I had his carrier ready with blanket inside to keep him comfy. Once I brought him home he was confused because he didn't know where he was he would walk around the apartment sniffing and lay down. He knew how to use a litter box and even lick himself as a baby which was amazing I wouldn't have to show him how to use the litter box!
